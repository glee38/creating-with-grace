Goal: Build an art blog/tutorial site

Gems:
- Devise (integerate omniauth within)
- Omniauth
- Pundit
- Carrierwave

Remember to include:
- Nested resource routes

- Partials

- ActiveRecord class level scope methods
  - example: Reports make for a good usage of class scopes, such as "Most Valuable Cart by Customer" where the code would implement a `Cart.most_valuable` and `Cart.by_customer` which could be combined as `Cart.most_valuable.by_customer(@customer)`

- Forms should correctly display validation errors. 
  - Your fields should be enclosed within a `fields_with_errors` class and error messages describing the validation failures must be present within the view.

- Must include a nested form that writes to an associated model through a custom attribute writer
  - category_attributes=(category_hash)
  - post[category_attributes][0][name]
